        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of creating our website is to grow the business and build our revenue. We want to reach a larger
            audience base to share our passion for white water rafting. That audience includes local and out-of-state
            customers. Whether the potential customer is a veteran or a newbie to white water rafting, we want to show
            them a warm welcome to our site and how we are the best experts to plan their rafting trip. The website
            should also include information like pictures to share our experiences. We want it to be a one-stop shop for
            anyone interested in rafting.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation,
            interests, and so on)
            Our target customers would be ones in groups (over 1 person). They would be in the age range of 14 to 55.
            Potential customers would be interested in either being outdoors, water, boating, and adventurous. Their
            financial situation would be one of the middle class or higher since they can afford to take time off from
            work and take a vacation.</p>
        <p>What do they want?
            A target customer would want to have a thrilling ride and adventure all while feeling safe with our trained
            professionals. They are seeking to create memories with their family and friends that they can cherish
            forever. They would also be interested in knowing the best places and experience levels for rafting
            locations. Customers would also be interested in knowing more about the history of rafting and the dos and
            don'ts.</p>
        <p>How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?
            The majority would probably be using mobile devices since these types of customers like to be out and about
            with nature or at least away from a desk. We still plan on making our site responsive so that it is a
            pleasant experience for all viewers of the site. </p>
